## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains **complete, production-ready implementations** of all projects from the [AI Infrastructure Engineer Learning Repository](https://github.com/ai-infra-curriculum/ai-infra-engineer-learning). Each project includes:

- ✅ **Fully functional code** - No stubs, complete implementations
- 📚 **Step-by-step guides** - Detailed implementation walkthroughs
- 🏗️ **Architecture documentation** - System design and component interactions
- 🐳 **Docker configurations** - Multi-stage builds, docker-compose setups
- ☸️ **Kubernetes manifests** - Production-ready deployments with scaling
- 🧪 **Comprehensive test suites** - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- 📊 **Monitoring setup** - Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, alerts
- 🚀 **CI/CD pipelines** - Automated testing, building, and deployment
- 🔧 **Setup scripts** - One-command deployment and testing
- 📖 **Troubleshooting guides** - Common issues and solutions

## ✨ What's New

**2026-05-27 — Module-level rationale docs + CI runtime validation + layout cleanup**

- Added module-level `SOLUTION.md` design-rationale docs for all 10 modules (mod-101 through mod-110). Each doc explains *why* the reference implementations are shaped the way they are — what trade-offs were accepted, common grader-observed mistakes, and when to go beyond. Complements the existing per-exercise `SOLUTION_GUIDE.md` walkthroughs.
- CI workflow now includes runtime validation gates: `kubectl apply --dry-run=client`, `terraform validate`, and a cache-only `docker buildx build` smoke for every relevant artifact under `modules/`. Each gate auto-skips when no relevant artifacts are present.
- Renamed `modules/mod-110-llm-infrastructure/exercise-12-llm-scoring-harness/` → `exercise-12-llm-evaluation-harness/` so the directory matches the paired learning-side exercise file name.
- Audit score: 58 → 64.

**2026-05-23 — Phase D complete: 100% exercise coverage**

All 119 learning exercises across all 10 modules now have reference solutions. Working
code/configs/manifests + benchmarks where applicable. See [`SOLUTIONS_INDEX.md`](./SOLUTIONS_INDEX.md)
for the full coverage matrix.
